	<h1>Time,Space,Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science used to evaluate the efficiency of an algorithm. It refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of the input data efficient. algorithms aim to minimize time complexity</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b>, Space complexity measures the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to the size of the input. Efficient use of memory is crucial for optimizing performance for ex:- O(n). denotes complexity</p>
