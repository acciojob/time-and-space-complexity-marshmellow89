	<h1> Time,Space,Complexity</h1>
	<p1>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science used to evaluate the efficiency of an algorithm. It refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of the input data. efficient algorithms aim to minimize time complexity</p1>
	<p2><b>Space Complexity</b>, measures the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to the size of the input. Efficient use of memory is crucial for optimizing performance for ex:-O(n) denotes complexity<p2>
